# StatisticalLearningPython

This repository contains Python code and answers for the exercises in the book: An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. 

All book resources can be found from this link:http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/.

If you have a hard time reading the book cover to cover, you can watch the lecture videos taught by the book authors: 
https://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/. But it'd be better to have some basic statistic knowledges and programming skills as prerequisites. 

There are tons of reference code for the book on Github. BUT a suggestion is that do NOT look at my or any other's reference code until you finish yours. Practice your understanding of the book and analysis skills on your own.  

I started this book from the beginning of 2020. Since I have two long-hour full-time jobs, the progress has been slow. I'm in the middle of Chapel 4 and I'll submit the Python code for Chapel 4 shortly.
